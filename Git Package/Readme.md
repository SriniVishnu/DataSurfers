## 1. Introduction
     
   Greenhouse gases refer to the sum of the gases that have direct impacts on climate change. These seven gases are :
   carbon dioxide(CO2), methane(CH4), nitrous oxide(N20), chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons(HFCs), perfluorocarbons(PFCs)
   superhexaflouride(SF6), nitrogen triflouride(NF3)
   The data are expressed in CO2 equivalents and refer to gross direct emissions from human activities. CO2 refers to gross direct 
   emissions from fuel combustion only and data are provided by the International Energy Agency.
   Air and greenhouse gas emissions are measured in thousand tonnes, tonnes per capita or kilograms  per capita except for 
   CO2, which is measured in million tonnes and tonnes per capita.
